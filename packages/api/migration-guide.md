# Phase 2 Migration Summary: Fiber to Echo & OpenAPI Generator

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Tooling Setup
- Created `/tools/openapi-generator.sh` wrapper script for OpenAPI Generator CLI v7.8.0
- Set up automatic download and caching of the generator JAR
- Added generation commands to `tool.go` for parallel usage with existing oapi-codegen

### 2. ✅ Configuration Translation
- Created `openapi-generator.json` with equivalent settings to `cfg.yaml`
- Configured Echo server generation with proper package structure
- Set up git project metadata for proper import paths

### 3. ✅ Staged Generation
- Generated Echo server stubs to `packages/api/gen/` directory
- Preserved existing oapi-codegen output for comparison
- Created parallel codebase structure for gradual migration

### 4. ✅ Model Compatibility Analysis

**Key Differences Identified:**

| Aspect | Current (oapi-codegen) | New (OpenAPI Generator) |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Model Fields | Pointer types (`*string`, `*time.Time`) | Value types (`string`, `time.Time`) |
| Context | `*fiber.Ctx` | `echo.Context` |
| Response Format | `c.Status().JSON()` | `ctx.JSON()` |
| Context Variables | `c.Locals("key", value)` | `ctx.Set("key", value)` |
| Parameter Access | `c.Query()`, `c.BodyParser()` | `ctx.QueryParam()`, `ctx.Bind()` |

### 5. ✅ Implementation Framework
- Created `impl_echo.go` with Echo server interface implementation
- Demonstrated conversion patterns between Fiber and Echo contexts
- Provided adapter functions for handling model differences

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 3: Server Framework Migration (Next Steps)

1. **Add Echo Dependencies**
   ```bash
   go get github.com/labstack/echo/v4
   go get github.com/labstack/echo/v4/middleware
   ```

2. **Update Authentication Middleware**
   - Convert Fiber middleware logic to Echo equivalents
   - Update context variable handling (`c.Locals()` → `ctx.Set()/ctx.Get()`)
   - Maintain same authentication rules and security

3. **Gradual Handler Migration**
   - Start with simple endpoints (Health, Config)
   - Progressively migrate complex endpoints
   - Keep both implementations running during transition

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Use `models_test.go` for compatibility validation
   - Run parallel tests on both implementations
   - Ensure JSON contract compatibility

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Broader Language Support**: Official generator supports more target languages
2. **Consistent Code Style**: Standardized generation across services
3. **Active Maintenance**: OpenAPI Generator has regular updates and community support
4. **Future-Proof**: Echo framework has strong adoption and long-term support

## Risk Mitigation

- **Parallel Development**: Both generators can run simultaneously
- **Gradual Migration**: No need for big-bang approach
- **Backward Compatibility**: JSON contracts remain unchanged
- **Rollback Capability**: Can revert to Fiber implementation if needed

## Next Steps for Phase 3

1. Update main application to include Echo dependencies
2. Port authentication middleware from Fiber to Echo
3. Begin handler migration starting with simple endpoints
4. Update routing configuration to use Echo router
5. Comprehensive testing of migrated endpoints
6. Gradual phase-out of Fiber implementation

This phase successfully demonstrates that the OpenAPI Generator migration is technically feasible while maintaining API contract compatibility.
