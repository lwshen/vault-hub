## Authentication

The CLI uses API keys for authentication. First, create an API key in the web interface:

1. Log into the VaultHub web interface
2. Navigate to Dashboard â†’ API Keys
3. Click "Create API Key" and give it a name
4. Copy the generated API key (starts with `vhub_`)

### Setting Up Authentication

```bash
# Set the API key as an environment variable
export VAULT_HUB_API_KEY=vhub_your_api_key_here

# Or pass it directly to commands
vault-hub --api-key vhub_your_api_key_here list
```

## Commands
